# Iris-Species-Classifier

The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic beginner-friendly machine learning project that involves classifying iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 

Dataset: The Iris dataset, available in scikit-learn or UCI Machine Learning Repository, contains 150 samples with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and 3 classes (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
Task: Build a classification model to predict the species of an iris flower based on its features.
Classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, SVM)
Data preprocessing (standardization, handling numerical data)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)
Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
